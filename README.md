# Matrix Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Calculator

This Python script is designed to help users calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 3x3 matrix they provide. Additionally, it generates the characteristic equation for the matrix. The script offers an interactive interface, guiding the user through the input process and providing a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the calculations.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matrix-eigenvalue-calculator.git
```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory

3. Run the Script: Execute the script in a Python environment  or run using the notebook   

4. Enter Matrix Elements: Input the nine elements of your 3x3 matrix one by one when prompted. The script will display the matrix for your confirmation.

5. Confirm Matrix: Confirm if the entered matrix is correct by typing 'y' or 'Y', or re-enter it by typing 'n' or 'N'.

6. Calculate Eigenvalues: If the matrix is correct, the script will calculate the eigenvalues and display the characteristic equation.

7. Calculate Eigenvectors: The script will then proceed to calculate and display the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.  

## Note
This script is designed for educational purposes and may not cover all edge cases. Please ensure your matrix is properly formatted and suitable for eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations before using this script in practical applications.
